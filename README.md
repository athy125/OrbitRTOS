# Satellite RTOS Task Scheduler Simulator

## Overview
This project implements a real-time operating system (RTOS) simulator specifically designed for managing periodic and event-driven satellite tasks. The simulator allows for testing, visualization, and validation of task scheduling algorithms and inter-task communication in a space systems context.

## Features
- Custom RTOS kernel with preemptive scheduling
- Priority-based and time-based task scheduling
- Inter-task communication mechanisms (message queues, semaphores)
- Simulated satellite task environment
- Deadline monitoring and analysis
- Console-based visualization of task execution
- Configurable system parameters

## Requirements
- GCC compiler (version 7.0 or higher recommended)
- Standard C library
- POSIX-compliant environment (Linux/Unix preferred)
